Inspired by Nike - Design your own shoes. This web application allows the user to customize the color pallet of Nike AirForce Max, save those changes to a gallery of Non-Fungible Kix and the ability to purchase using Ethereum.

User Functionality:

* User is able to select individual components of a shoe, and customize the color setting from a color pallet
* User is able to change their mind of any shoe part to dynamically update the background color
* Hovering over each shoe part tile will highlight the relevant part of the shoe
* Hovering over each color tile will dynamically change the color of the shoe component that has been selected
* User is able to select the background color of their NFK
* Saving the finished design as an NFK will push the design to the gallery on the next page, render the design as an image and post to a back-end database
* The Gallery screen will show a list of preset designs as well as any designs from the user
* Pricing of each NFK is based on the complexity of the design - additional colors will increase base price
* User is able to select NFKs in the Gallery for purchase by clicking the BUY button. Alternatively, clicking on an image of the NFK will take the user back to the Design screen and allow user to make edits
* Clicking the BUY button in the Gallery will take the user to the Checkout page. The user is able to customize the name of their chosen NFK, add ETH to their wallet and upon checkout, be taken back to the Gallery page showing that their NFK has been sold. A sold NFK can not be edited or repurchased.
